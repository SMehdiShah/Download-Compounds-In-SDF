# ðŸ§ª Compounds Harvester
Compound Harvester is a Python-based tool designed to download and merge compound structures in .sdf (Structure Data File) format from online chemical databases (e.g., NPAtlas). It takes a list of compound IDs, fetches each corresponding structure via API, and compiles them into a single SDF file for downstream cheminformatics workflows such as molecular docking, virtual screening, or QSAR modeling.
