# 🧪 Compounds Harvester
Compound Harvester is a Python-based tool designed to download and merge compound structures in .sdf (Structure Data File) format from online chemical databases (e.g., NPAtlas). It takes a list of compound IDs, fetches each corresponding structure via API, and compiles them into a single SDF file for downstream cheminformatics workflows such as molecular docking, virtual screening, or QSAR modeling.
## 🚀 Features
- 🔁 Batch download of multiple compound structures using compound IDs
- 🌐 Accesses compound data from NPAtlas API (can be adapted to other sources)
- 📦 Merges all compounds into a single .sdf file
- 📊 Displays real-time download progress with a clean progress bar
- 🧩 Easy to integrate into cheminformatics pipelines
